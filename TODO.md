# 📋 TODO — Principle gaps to fill

## 🧪 Testing principles
Extend `code/ts`

- [ ] Test pyramid — maintain a deliberately unequal ratio of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; more fast unit tests, fewer slow E2E tests
- [ ] Consumer-driven contract testing — consumers define the contract they need from a provider; the provider's test suite verifies it is met (e.g. Pact)
- [ ] Property-based testing — specify invariants and let a framework generate hundreds of inputs to find edge cases example-based tests miss

## 📡 Observability methods
Extend `code/ob`

- [ ] USE method — for every infrastructure resource, track Utilisation, Saturation, and Errors; these three signals predict most resource-related failures
- [ ] RED method — for every service, track Rate, Errors, and Duration; these three signals define the user-visible health of a service
- [ ] Error budget — define acceptable unreliability as an SLO error budget; when it is exhausted, reliability work takes priority over features

## 🏛️ Architecture patterns
Extend `arch` or new namespace: `arch-patterns`

- [ ] Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) — isolate domain logic behind ports; adapters implement ports for specific technologies. Distinct from Clean Architecture's dependency rule in its explicit port/adapter vocabulary
- [ ] Saga pattern — coordinate distributed transactions across services using a sequence of local transactions with compensating actions on failure
- [ ] Strangler Fig — incrementally replace a legacy system by routing traffic to a new implementation piece by piece, running both in parallel until the old system can be retired

## 🚢 Continuous delivery practices
New namespace: `cd`

- [ ] Trunk-based development — commit to the main branch frequently; avoid long-lived feature branches
- [ ] Keep the build green — a failing build is the team's highest priority; nothing else ships until it passes
- [ ] Deploy on every commit — the pipeline should be capable of releasing any green commit to production
- [ ] Feature flags for continuous delivery — decouple deployment from release; hide incomplete work behind flags rather than branches
- [ ] Fast feedback loops — optimise the pipeline so engineers know within minutes whether a change is safe
- [ ] GitOps — infrastructure and application state is declared in git; an operator continuously reconciles actual state to match

## 🌐 API design
Extend `code/api`

- [ ] API versioning strategy — version APIs explicitly; define a policy for introducing breaking changes and supporting deprecated versions
- [ ] gRPC / Protobuf design — define service contracts in `.proto` files; use field numbers for backward compatibility; prefer streaming for high-throughput flows

## ⚙️ Configuration file principles
New namespace: `config-principles` (to populate the `config` group more fully)

- [ ] Schema-first configuration — every config file has a declared schema; invalid configuration is rejected at load time, not discovered at runtime
- [ ] Explicit over conventional — prefer named, explicit configuration keys over magic conventions that require knowing the framework defaults

## 📝 Documentation principles
New namespace: `docs-principles` (to populate the `docs` group more fully)

- [ ] Docs as code — documentation lives in version control, is reviewed like code, and is built/validated in CI
- [ ] Write for a specific audience — every document has a named reader; structure and vocabulary serve that reader, not the author
- [ ] Progressive disclosure — lead with the summary; let readers drill into detail on demand; never bury the conclusion
- [ ] Docs close to code — documentation lives alongside what it describes; distance between docs and code invites drift
