# TODO — Principle gaps to fill

## Functional programming principles
New namespace: `fp`

- [ ] Pure functions — functions with no side effects and deterministic output
- [ ] Referential transparency — expressions that can be replaced by their value without changing program behaviour
- [ ] Immutability as design — prefer immutable data structures; make mutation explicit and localised
- [ ] Function composition — build complex behaviour by composing small, single-purpose functions
- [ ] Avoid shared mutable state — favour data transformation pipelines over stateful objects

## Continuous delivery practices
New namespace: `cd`

- [ ] Trunk-based development — commit to the main branch frequently; avoid long-lived feature branches
- [ ] Keep the build green — a failing build is the team's highest priority; nothing else ships until it passes
- [ ] Deploy on every commit — the pipeline should be capable of releasing any green commit to production
- [ ] Feature flags for continuous delivery — decouple deployment from release; hide incomplete work behind flags rather than branches
- [ ] Fast feedback loops — optimise the pipeline so engineers know within minutes whether a change is safe
- [ ] GitOps — infrastructure and application state is declared in git; an operator continuously reconciles actual state to match

## Database / persistence design
New namespace: `db`

- [ ] Avoid N+1 queries — never issue a query per row of a result set; use joins, batch loads, or eager loading
- [ ] Index for access patterns — design indexes based on the queries the application actually runs, not the schema shape
- [ ] Normalise to third normal form by default — eliminate redundancy and update anomalies; denormalise only with a measured reason
- [ ] Schema migrations are code — every schema change is version-controlled, reviewed, and applied through an automated pipeline
- [ ] Separate read and write models where load demands it — CQRS: optimise query models independently of command models when they have diverging requirements
- [ ] Outbox pattern — write events to a database outbox table in the same transaction as the domain change; relay them asynchronously to avoid dual-write inconsistency

## OOP / object design principles
Extend existing namespaces or new namespace: `oop`

- [ ] Law of Demeter — a method should only call methods on its direct collaborators; never chain through intermediaries
- [ ] Tell Don't Ask — tell objects what to do rather than asking for their state and deciding outside them

## Architecture patterns
Extend `arch` or new namespace: `arch-patterns`

- [ ] Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) — isolate domain logic behind ports; adapters implement ports for specific technologies. Distinct from Clean Architecture's dependency rule in its explicit port/adapter vocabulary
- [ ] Saga pattern — coordinate distributed transactions across services using a sequence of local transactions with compensating actions on failure
- [ ] Strangler Fig — incrementally replace a legacy system by routing traffic to a new implementation piece by piece, running both in parallel until the old system can be retired

## Security principles
Extend `infra` or new namespace: `sec-arch`

- [ ] Threat modelling — systematically identify and rank threats against a system before implementation; use STRIDE or PASTA to structure the analysis
- [ ] Zero trust — never grant implicit trust based on network location; every request must be authenticated, authorised, and encrypted regardless of origin
- [ ] Supply chain security — verify the integrity of all dependencies, container base images, and build tools; generate and attest SBOMs; sign artifacts

## Testing principles
Extend `code/ts`

- [ ] Test pyramid — maintain a deliberately unequal ratio of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; more fast unit tests, fewer slow E2E tests
- [ ] Consumer-driven contract testing — consumers define the contract they need from a provider; the provider's test suite verifies it is met (e.g. Pact)
- [ ] Property-based testing — specify invariants and let a framework generate hundreds of inputs to find edge cases example-based tests miss

## Observability methods
Extend `code/ob`

- [ ] USE method — for every infrastructure resource, track Utilisation, Saturation, and Errors; these three signals predict most resource-related failures
- [ ] RED method — for every service, track Rate, Errors, and Duration; these three signals define the user-visible health of a service
- [ ] Error budget — define acceptable unreliability as an SLO error budget; when it is exhausted, reliability work takes priority over features

## API design
Extend `code/api`

- [ ] API versioning strategy — version APIs explicitly; define a policy for introducing breaking changes and supporting deprecated versions
- [ ] gRPC / Protobuf design — define service contracts in `.proto` files; use field numbers for backward compatibility; prefer streaming for high-throughput flows
