# ARCH-LAYERED — Layered Architecture

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** architecture, separation-of-concerns
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Organise software into horizontal layers where each layer has a specific responsibility and may only depend on the layer directly below it. Common layering: Presentation → Application/Business Logic → Domain → Infrastructure/Persistence. No layer may skip a layer to reach one further down, and no lower layer may depend on a higher layer.

## Why it matters

Layering creates predictable dependency direction, making each layer independently testable and replaceable. Violations — presentation logic in the database layer, business logic in controllers, data access in the UI — produce code that cannot be tested without instantiating the full stack and cannot be changed without ripple effects across unrelated concerns.

## Violations to detect

- Controllers or view handlers containing business logic or database queries
- Domain objects importing web framework types or ORM annotations directly
- Persistence layer calling back into business logic
- Tests that cannot exercise one layer without instantiating all layers

## Good practice

- Map each layer to a package or module boundary; enforce the rule with architectural tests (ArchUnit, Dependency Cruiser, import-linter)
- Define clear interfaces at each layer boundary
- Keep business logic in the domain/application layer — the persistence layer is a detail
