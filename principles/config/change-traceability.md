# CONFIG-CHANGE-TRACEABILITY — All configuration changes must be versioned, reviewed, and auditable

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** configuration, auditability, security, devops
**Applies-to:** config

## Principle

Every change to a configuration value must be traceable: who changed it, what changed, when, and why. Configuration changes flow through version control and peer review — the same process as code changes. Ad-hoc manual edits to configuration on running systems are prohibited except in declared, time-limited break-glass procedures that are logged and followed by a post-incident config reconciliation.

## Why it matters

Configuration changes are a leading cause of production incidents. Without traceability, diagnosing "what changed before the outage" requires guesswork. Without review, a single misconfiguration — a wrong timeout, a missing flag, a rotated key not propagated — can take down a service. GitOps and change-management disciplines extend code review and audit practices to the configuration plane.

## Violations to detect

- Configuration files that exist only on running servers and are not committed to version control
- Evidence of SSH-based or console-based config edits (files with modification timestamps that post-date the last deploy)
- Config values in production that differ from what is declared in VCS without a documented reason
- Secrets management systems (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) used without audit logging enabled
- No record of who approved a configuration change or why

## Good practice

- Commit all configuration files to version control; require pull request approval before merging config changes
- Use GitOps workflows (ArgoCD, Flux, GitHub Actions) to deploy config from VCS, ensuring the running config matches the declared config
- Enable audit logging in secrets management systems: Vault audit devices, AWS CloudTrail for Secrets Manager, Azure Policy
- Define and document break-glass procedures for emergency config changes; require a follow-up PR to reconcile VCS within 24 hours
- Include config diffs in deployment manifests so reviewers see exactly what changed
