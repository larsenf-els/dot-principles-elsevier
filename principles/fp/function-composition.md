# FP-FUNCTION-COMPOSITION — Function composition

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** functional-programming, software-design, maintainability
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Build complex behaviour by combining small, single-purpose functions where the output of one becomes the input of the next. Composition is the primary mechanism for building large programs from small, tested, reusable pieces — analogous to how Unix pipelines combine simple tools. Each composed function remains independently testable and reusable.

## Why it matters

When logic is encoded in large, monolithic functions, every change risks breaking multiple concerns simultaneously. Composed pipelines of small functions are easier to reason about — each step has one job and can be verified independently. Composition also enables reuse: a function written for one pipeline can be dropped into another without modification.

## Violations to detect

- Functions longer than ~20 lines that mix multiple transformation steps into a single body
- Duplicated transformation sequences in different parts of the codebase that could be extracted and composed
- Intermediate variables named `temp`, `result`, `data` that exist solely to thread a value from one step to the next
- Nested function calls more than 3 levels deep that could be flattened with a pipe or compose operator

## Good practice

- Write functions that take one input and return one output; keep them short enough to understand without scrolling
- Use `compose` or `pipe` operators/utilities to assemble pipelines declaratively (`pipe(validate, transform, format)`)
- Name composed pipelines after what they accomplish, not how (`processOrder` not `validateThenTransformThenFormat`)
- Test each constituent function independently before testing the composed pipeline
