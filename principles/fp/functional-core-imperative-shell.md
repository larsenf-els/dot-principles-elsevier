# FP-FUNCTIONAL-CORE-IMPERATIVE-SHELL — Functional core, imperative shell

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** functional-programming, software-design, testability, architecture
**Applies-to:** all

## Principle

Structure programs with a pure functional core — containing all business logic as data transformations — surrounded by a thin imperative shell that handles I/O, side effects, and integration with the outside world. The shell translates real-world inputs into data, calls the core to transform it, and translates the output back into real-world effects. The core never performs I/O; the shell contains minimal logic.

## Why it matters

When business logic is interleaved with I/O (database reads, API calls, file writes), testing requires mocking or faking every external dependency. Separating the core from the shell means the business logic — the part most likely to be complex and buggy — can be tested with plain input/output assertions, no mocks required. The shell, being thin and mechanical, rarely contains bugs worth testing.

## Violations to detect

- Service classes or functions that mix domain calculations with database queries or HTTP calls in the same body
- Business rules that cannot be tested without setting up external infrastructure
- Domain objects that call repositories, loggers, or external services directly
- Functions that compute a result and then immediately perform an I/O action with it in the same scope

## Good practice

- Identify the pure transformation at the heart of each use case and express it as a function from inputs to outputs with no I/O
- Write the shell as a sequence: gather all inputs via I/O → call the pure core → execute the resulting effects
- Prefer returning a description of effects (a command object, an event list, a set of instructions) from the core rather than performing them — let the shell execute what the core decided
- Test the core with pure unit tests; test the shell with integration tests focused on wiring correctness, not business logic
