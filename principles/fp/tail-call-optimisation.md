# FP-TAIL-CALL-OPTIMISATION — Tail-call optimisation

**Layer:** 2 (contextual)
**Categories:** functional-programming, performance, reliability
**Applies-to:** haskell, scala, erlang, elixir, f#, clojure, kotlin

## Principle

A recursive call is in tail position when it is the very last operation performed before the function returns — the caller has nothing left to do after the recursive call completes. Runtimes that implement tail-call optimisation (TCO) reuse the current stack frame for tail calls, making tail-recursive functions consume O(1) stack space regardless of recursion depth. When TCO is not available, use trampolining or an explicit stack.

## Why it matters

Without TCO, deep recursion overflows the call stack. This is not a theoretical concern: recursive processing of large data structures (trees, lists, streams) in production regularly hits stack limits. The fix — manually converting clean recursive logic into a loop with an accumulator — sacrifices readability and the structural clarity of the recursive form. Tail-recursive style preserves both.

## Violations to detect

- Recursive functions processing unbounded input where the recursive call is NOT in tail position (e.g., `1 + recurse(n-1)` — the addition happens after the recursive call)
- `@tailrec` annotation missing in Scala on functions intended to be tail-recursive (the compiler will not verify tail position without it)
- Deep recursion in runtimes without TCO (JVM without Scala/Kotlin optimisation, most JavaScript engines) on inputs that could be large
- Accumulator pattern implemented incorrectly, accumulating after the recursive call rather than before it

## Inspection

- `grep -rn "@tailrec" --include="*.scala" $TARGET` | LOW | Verify @tailrec annotations are present on intended tail-recursive Scala functions

## Good practice

- Rewrite non-tail-recursive functions to pass an accumulator argument, moving the combining operation from after the recursive call to before it
- In Scala, annotate intended tail-recursive functions with `@tailrec` to get a compile-time guarantee
- In languages without native TCO (JavaScript, Java), use trampolining (returning thunks and bouncing through a loop) for deep recursion
- Replace extremely deep recursion over known data structures with explicit stack-based iterative algorithms as a last resort
