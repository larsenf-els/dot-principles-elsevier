# Changelog

All notable changes to `.principles` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> **Note:** `.principles` is in its early days — this is an experimental release. The system is being actively used and iterated on, but expect rough edges, evolving formats, and breaking changes as things stabilize.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-18

### Changed

- **Artifact-type layer system** — `layers/artifact-types.yaml` classifies every reviewed file into one of 6 stacks (`code`, `docs`, `config`, `infra`, `pipeline`, `schema`), each with its own `layer-1-universal.md` and `layer-2-contexts.yaml` (plus `layer-3-risk-signals.yaml` for `code` and `infra`). A shared universal set of 6 principles (`SIMPLE-DESIGN-REVEALS-INTENTION`, `CODE-CS-DRY`, `CODE-CS-KISS`, `CODE-CS-YAGNI`, `CODE-DX-NAMING`, `ARCH-DECISION-RECORDS`) applies across all stacks; stack-specific layers add targeted principles on top. Type detection uses file extension, filename, and path-pattern signals, with `infra` evaluated before `config` to resolve ambiguous YAML files (e.g. `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`).

### Added

- **11 new continuous delivery principles** in new `cd` namespace — `CD-TRUNK-BASED-DEVELOPMENT`, `CD-KEEP-BUILD-GREEN`, `CD-DEPLOY-ON-EVERY-COMMIT`, `CD-FEATURE-FLAGS`, `CD-FAST-FEEDBACK-LOOPS`, `CD-GITOPS`, `CD-BLUE-GREEN-DEPLOYMENT`, `CD-CANARY-RELEASE`, `CD-DEPLOYMENT-SMOKE-TESTS`, `CD-PIPELINE-AS-CODE`, `CD-BUILD-ONCE-DEPLOY-MANY`. 4 principles include `## Inspection` grep patterns (`CD-KEEP-BUILD-GREEN`, `CD-FEATURE-FLAGS`, `CD-PIPELINE-AS-CODE`, `CD-BUILD-ONCE-DEPLOY-MANY`). 4 principles are `Audit-scope: limited` (`CD-TRUNK-BASED-DEVELOPMENT`, `CD-DEPLOY-ON-EVERY-COMMIT`, `CD-FAST-FEEDBACK-LOOPS`, `CD-BLUE-GREEN-DEPLOYMENT`, `CD-CANARY-RELEASE`). New `groups/cd.yaml`, catalog, and context files created.
- **24 new architecture and integration principles** — 15 in `arch` namespace (Hexagonal Architecture, Saga, Strangler Fig, Layered Architecture, Microkernel, Anti-Corruption Layer, BFF, Bulkhead, Service Layer, Unit of Work, MVC, API Gateway, Data Mapper, Active Record, Transaction Script); 4 DDD strategic patterns in `ddd` namespace (Context Map, Shared Kernel, Open Host Service, Published Language); 5 Enterprise Integration Patterns in new `eip` namespace (Correlation Identifier, Content-Based Router, Dead Letter Channel, Message Filter, Claim Check). `eip` catalog, context, and group files created. `groups/microservices.yaml` and `groups/ddd.yaml` updated.
- **7 new observability principles** in `code/ob` — USE Method (Gregg), RED Method (Wilkie), Error Budget burn-rate alerting, Four Golden Signals, Health Check API (Richardson), Percentile-based latency (Dean & Barroso), Alert on symptoms not causes. `CODE-OB-ERROR-BUDGET` and `CODE-OB-HEALTH-CHECK-API` include `## Inspection` grep patterns. `CODE-OB-ALERT-ON-SYMPTOMS` is `Audit-scope: limited`. `groups/microservices.yaml`, context files, and `catalog.yaml` (242 principles) updated.
- **7 new testing principles** in `code/ts` — Test Data Builder, Humble Object, No Test Logic in Production (with inspection), Characterization Tests (`Audit-scope: limited`), Test Pyramid, Consumer-Driven Contracts, Property-Based Testing.
- **Audit-scope metadata** — `principles/AUDIT-SCOPE.md` added; 8 principle files annotated (4 excluded, 4 limited).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — code auditability and no-redundancy requirements added.
- **`principles/TEMPLATE.md`** — optional `**Audit-scope:**` field documented.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-03-17

### Changed

- **Installer copies principle data to `~/.principles`** — created on install, refreshed on every run; `{{PRINCIPLES_DIRECTORY}}` placeholder substituted at install time in command files. Global uninstall removes `~/.principles`; local uninstalls leave it intact.

### Added

- **14 new database principles** in new `db` namespace — `DB-ACID`, `DB-SCHEMA-MIGRATIONS-AS-CODE`, `DB-CAP-THEOREM`, `DB-AVOID-N-PLUS-ONE` (with inspection), `DB-INDEX-FOR-ACCESS-PATTERNS`, `DB-THIRD-NORMAL-FORM`, `DB-CQRS`, `DB-OUTBOX-PATTERN`, `DB-EVENTUAL-CONSISTENCY`, `DB-EVENT-SOURCING`, `DB-OPTIMISTIC-CONCURRENCY`, `DB-TWO-PHASE-LOCKING`, `DB-POLYGLOT-PERSISTENCE`, `DB-DENORMALIZE-INTENTIONALLY`. New `@db` group and context files.
- **7 new security principles** — 4 in `code/sec` (`DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH`, `FAIL-SAFE-DEFAULTS` with inspection, `COMPLETE-MEDIATION`, `PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN`) and 3 in new `sec-arch` namespace (`THREAT-MODELLING`, `ZERO-TRUST`, `SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY` with inspection). `groups/security-focused.yaml` updated.
- **27 new OOP/object-design principles** — `pkg` namespace (6 Package Principles, Martin); `gof` additions (Law of Demeter, Null Object); `code/cs` additions (Design by Contract, Tell Don't Ask, Information Hiding, Uniform Access); 9 Fowler code smells; 5 Effective Java items; `DDD-SPECIFICATION`.
- **20 functional programming principles** in new `fp` namespace — 4 universal (pure functions, referential transparency, immutability, no shared mutable state), 16 contextual. New `@fp` group and 11 new language groups (`@javascript`, `@swift`, `@ruby`, `@php`, `@scala`, `@cpp`, `@c`, `@dart`, `@elixir`, `@haskell`, `@fsharp`).
